# Title of Project 

The project title should capture the project without being too verbose. Often if you are utilizing certain statistical methods you should include the specific or overarching methods in your title, along with subject matter for your respective data set. Since many of our projects are not being created as standalone modules we must be help accountable for naming our repos appropriately. You can also get creative with the title, but be sure its descriptive enough. 

Good Examples:
+ class-listings-scraper
+ StolenBikesinUCSB
+ fakeNewsPredictions

## Abstract
Give us a paragraph detailing your project

## Steps
These steps are often steps not included within the scripts themselves so like reminders for virtual environment set up, database management, api keys set up, etc. 

## Statistical Analysis
Give a brief overview of any statistical analysis you used in your project. This should not be verbose either but should tell people enough of the project for them to know context. Example includes predictive models, specific statistical analysis (i.e. Time Series Analysis), 

## Conclusion 
A brief conclusion relating to your statistical analysis as well as any key takeaways relating to the project as a whole (lessons learned, potential drawbacks, future expansion ideas). 

## To-Do List
This can be created anywhere in the repo, but include a to-do list to help you and your teammates check yourselves in check.
