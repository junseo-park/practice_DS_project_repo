# Title of Project 

The project title should capture the project without being too verbose. Often if you are utilizing certain statistical methods you should include the specific or overarching methods in your title, along with subject matter for your respective data set. Since many of our projects are not being created as standalone modules we must be help accountable for naming our repos appropriately. You can also get creative with the title, but be sure its descriptive enough. 

Good Examples:
